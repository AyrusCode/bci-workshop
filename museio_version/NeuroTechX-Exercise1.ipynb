      "In this exercise, you will learn how to visualize the brainwaves (technically called Electroencephalography signals, or EEG signals for short) using a python interface. It won't be nearly as fancy as MuseLab, but it will give you the same information. The fact that you are able to look at your own brainwaves means that you have created a \"Neurofeedback Interface.\" This is the simplest form of a brain computer interface! You have created a way to get feedback about what your brain is doing. You can then use this feedback to learn how to alter your brain is doing. This is the basis of \"Neurofeedback Therapy,\" which can be used to help with things like Attention Defecit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Anxiety, Pain, etc. \n",
